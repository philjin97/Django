#### Agricultural products are currently experiencing big problems. 
#### The producers (farmers) are the ones who can't get paid enough even if they face huge risks. They don't know where to sell their products which mean they face selling their products to bad alternatives / can't sell. 
#### The agricultural products are sold through auctions or they are sold by other middle-man online. The bulk of the money goes to the middle-man or the company in the middle.
#### The consumers have to pay twice the original price meaning that they can't have food on the table easily.

#### This structure means that even less people opt in for becoming farmers and move to the cities. Only the middle-man makes money.

#### Solution: Change the structure. Easy platform that old populations who are often not friendly with tech and education can use to sell agricultural products easily. Get a driver in the middle who can deliver the products instead of a company. Consumer can easily access the agricultural products for a very cheap price.
